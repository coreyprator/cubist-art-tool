RULES (read carefully; apply before anything else)
R1. Return ENTIRE FILES only, never diffs or snippets.
R2. Preserve all logging / progress / history features unchanged.
R3. No prose outside file blocks. One file per block.

OUTPUT CONTRACT
- Use file blocks delimited by: ```file ... ```
- Fields required in each block: path, language, contents
- One file per block. Emit ENTIRE FILES only.

EXAMPLE
```file
path: src/module.py
language: python
contents:
<full file contents here>
```

SENTINELS
- Start marker: ### FILE OUTPUT START relative file name, line count  ###
- End marker: ### END OF OUTPUT ###
- Self-check line (must appear before first file block): ✔ R1 ✔ R2 ✔ R3

SCENARIO: Troubleshooting
DESCRIPTION: Provide debugging guidance and code changes while obeying rule R1 (full files) and R2 (logging preserved).

TASK
refresh the history tab  after a Save to DB.

CONTEXT
G:\My Drive\Code\Python\cubist_art\tools\promptforge.py

ERRORS
When you send code files, you add at the top information that isn't code:
path: tools/promptforge.py
language: python
contents:
It needs to be commented or outside the code copy/paste box.

PromptForge app needs to refresh the history tab  after a Save to DB.

Add a preview and retreive button to pull an item into the prompt form.

OBSERVED_BEHAVIOR
Cause code bugs

EXPECTED_BEHAVIOR
Comment out that information in the code text box.
all code needs to be smoke tested

REPRO_STEPS
To reproduce the problem for: app needs to refresh the history page after a Save to DB.
1. Create content in Prompt tab.
2. Click Save to DB
3. Click History
4. You should see the new DB item.

EXTRA DIRECTIVES
- When proposing code changes, emit ENTIRE FILES per OUTPUT CONTRACT.
- If multiple files are needed, emit one file block per file.
- If you must explain, create a separate META.md as a full file block.

RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS
1) First line must be the self-check line exactly as below.
2) Then emit the start sentinel.
3) Then only file blocks per OUTPUT CONTRACT.
4) Finish with the end sentinel.

SELF-CHECK LINE
✔ R1 ✔ R2 ✔ R3

BEGIN RESPONSE WITH:
✔ R1 ✔ R2 ✔ R3
### FILE OUTPUT START relative file name, line count  ###
