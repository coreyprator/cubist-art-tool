1. Project Purpose
1.1. What‚Äôs the high-level goal of V2?
1.2. The purpose of version 2 of this project is to take the app to a new level of creativity.
1.3. V1 was a proof of concept: generate cubist images from a reference image.
1.4. V1 limitations: geometric shapes based on a fixed set of random points, bound by an input mask at the edge of the image.
1.5. V2 adds the following features.

2. Key New Features in V2
// The following features are intended to push the creative boundaries beyond V1‚Äôs geometry-locked design and static output limitations.
2.1. Expanded Input Support: Accepts both raster (PNG, JPEG) and, optionally, vector (SVG) images as input. JSON config files (required for advanced geometric and color customization) are supported.
2.2. Flexible Output Options: Exports to PNG, SVG (with layers/groups/metadata), and optionally layered PSD. Supports animated SVG morphs and image series for animation workflows.
2.3. Modular Plugin System: Easily add new shape modes, export types, or AI-based features (e.g., mask generation) without modifying core code.
2.4. Preset Management: Save, load, and share presets for shapes, palettes, brushes, and settings to streamline creative workflows.
2.5. AI-Assisted Masking: Optional integration with external tools or plugins for automated region selection and edge detection.
2.6. Cross-Platform & Web-Ready: Designed for Windows, macOS, and Linux, with planned support for web and mobile platforms in future versions. GUI can be Tkinter (desktop) or a lightweight web UI (browser/mobile).
2.7. Performance & Scalability: Async rendering and shape count limits maintain responsiveness, even with large images or complex fills.
2.8. Enhanced Usability: Clear documentation, tooltips, error messages, and debug overlays for color/geometry decisions.
2.9. Testability & Maintainability: Modular architecture, unit tests for rendering/geometry, and clean separation of logic and UI.

3. Canonical User Stories
3.1. üé® Digital Artist: As a digital artist, I want to export artwork as SVG or layered PSD so I can edit it precisely in Illustrator or Photoshop.
