# Milestone Summary — v2.1.0 (2025-08-18)

## What we achieved
- PNG and SVG rendering now match visually and numerically (shape counts).
- Deterministic runs via `--seed` ensure reproducible art generation.
- CLI emits `METRICS:` to support automated validation.
- Archive-only runs are clean; improved error/quiet logging.

## Why it matters
- Removes ambiguity during experimentation.
- Enables CI-friendly regression tests for geometry parity.
- Sets a solid base for more advanced artistry (curves, cascade, palettes).

## Next
- See roadmap in this doc (below).
Save this as MILESTONE_V2.1.0.md (or similar) inside your repo. This file will be your briefing to yourself in the new thread.

📌 Version

v2.1.0 (Milestone: SVG parity + validation, deterministic seeds, metrics, error handling)

Tagged and pushed to GitHub.

✅ Achievements in v2.1.0

PNG/SVG parity achieved — SVGs now match PNGs.

Deterministic seeds — reproducible runs with --seed.

Triple test harness (rectangles, delaunay, voronoi).

Metrics + validation — CLI outputs log and warns on parity issues.

Robust error handling — clearer exceptions, subprocess timeouts.

Docs added — CHANGELOG, RELEASE_NOTES, roadmap v2.2–2.3.

Build artifacts excluded — output/ and logs moved to .gitignore.

📝 Next Steps (Roadmap Ideas)

Reintroduce cascade fill (deferred from v2.1.0).

Explore curved/Bezier-based geometry (beyond strict cubism).

Add pytest suite + GitHub Actions for regression testing.

Investigate vector simplification pipelines (SVG manipulation).

Broader artistic explorations: hybrid cubist + organic curves.
