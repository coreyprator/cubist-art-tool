# Milestone Summary ‚Äî v2.1.0 (2025-08-18)

## What we achieved
- PNG and SVG rendering now match visually and numerically (shape counts).
- Deterministic runs via `--seed` ensure reproducible art generation.
- CLI emits `METRICS:` to support automated validation.
- Archive-only runs are clean; improved error/quiet logging.

## Why it matters
- Removes ambiguity during experimentation.
- Enables CI-friendly regression tests for geometry parity.
- Sets a solid base for more advanced artistry (curves, cascade, palettes).

## Next
- See roadmap in this doc (below).
Save this as MILESTONE_V2.1.0.md (or similar) inside your repo. This file will be your briefing to yourself in the new thread.

üìå Version

v2.1.0 (Milestone: SVG parity + validation, deterministic seeds, metrics, error handling)

Tagged and pushed to GitHub.

‚úÖ Achievements in v2.1.0

PNG/SVG parity achieved ‚Äî SVGs now match PNGs.

Deterministic seeds ‚Äî reproducible runs with --seed.

Triple test harness (rectangles, delaunay, voronoi).

Metrics + validation ‚Äî CLI outputs log and warns on parity issues.

Robust error handling ‚Äî clearer exceptions, subprocess timeouts.

Docs added ‚Äî CHANGELOG, RELEASE_NOTES, roadmap v2.2‚Äì2.3.

Build artifacts excluded ‚Äî output/ and logs moved to .gitignore.

üìù Next Steps (Roadmap Ideas)

Reintroduce cascade fill (deferred from v2.1.0).

Explore curved/Bezier-based geometry (beyond strict cubism).

Add pytest suite + GitHub Actions for regression testing.

Investigate vector simplification pipelines (SVG manipulation).

Broader artistic explorations: hybrid cubist + organic curves.

üîñ Git/Release Notes

Branch: v2 (tracks origin/v2).

Tag: v2.1.0 created & pushed.

Remote: origin https://github.com/coreyprator/cubist-art-tool.

Recommended: PR to merge v2 ‚Üí main or set v2 as default.
